# FaceDetectionUsingML
Face detection using Haar cascades is a machine learning-based approach that involves training a cascade function with a set of input data. Many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, and other features are already included in OpenCV. We'll be using the face classifier today. You can also experiment with different classifiers.
